# Contributing to the SpatialDDS Specification

Thank you for your interest in helping to improve SpatialDDS. We welcome fixes, clarifications, and new material that advance the specification and its supporting documents.

## How to Propose Changes

1. **Discuss major ideas first.** Open an issue to describe significant additions or revisions before submitting a patch.
2. **Keep changes focused.** Smaller, well scoped contributions are easier to review and merge.
3. **Follow the style of nearby text.** Preserve existing terminology, section structure, and formatting conventions when editing specification files.
4. **Document your rationale.** Explain why the change is needed and how it improves the project when you open a pull request.
