# SpatialDDS Specification (Concept)

SpatialDDS is a concept protocol for real-world spatial computing that defines a shared bus for spatial data, AI world models, and digital twins. You can browse the live specification at [spatialdds.org](https://spatialdds.org).

It's released to spark discussion—explore the spec, experiment, and join the conversation through issues or pull requests to help shape future iterations.

This repository hosts the published 1.3 specification alongside a work-in-progress 1.4 draft. See the [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md) for version history.


## Repository structure

- `SpatialDDS-1.2.md` / `SpatialDDS-1.3.md` / `SpatialDDS-1.4.md` – entry points that link to the specification's sections for each release.
- `SpatialDDS-1.2-full.md` / `SpatialDDS-1.3-full.md` / `SpatialDDS-1.4-full.md` – combined specifications generated from all sections.
- `sections/v*/` – markdown files containing each section of the specification, appendices, glossary, and references for a given version.
- `idl/v*/` – Interface Definition Language files for core, discovery, anchors, and other profiles as well as example IDL definitions, versioned with the spec.
- `manifests/v*/` – example JSON manifests illustrating how services, anchors, and content can advertise themselves within SpatialDDS, versioned alongside the spec.
- `scripts/` – helper scripts such as `build-spec.sh` for assembling the specification.

## Building the full specification

All IDL files in `idl/v*/` and manifest examples in `manifests/v*/` are treated as canonical. Markdown sections reference them with `{{include:...}}` placeholders. Regenerate the combined specification after modifying any of those files by running:

```bash
./scripts/build-spec.sh            # defaults to version 1.3
./scripts/build-spec.sh 1.4        # builds the 1.4 draft
```

The script injects the referenced IDL and manifest sources and writes `SpatialDDS-<version>-full.md` to the repository root, providing a convenient reference to the complete spec.

## Browsing the spec locally

The repository includes a lightweight [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) configuration so you can explore the spec with built-in navigation and search:

1. Install MkDocs and the required extensions (e.g. `pip install mkdocs mkdocs-mermaid2-plugin pymdown-extensions`).
2. Generate the MkDocs sources with `./scripts/prepare_mkdocs.py` (also invoked by `build-spec.sh`). This expands all `{{include:...}}` blocks and writes the result to `mkdocs_docs/`.
3. Launch a local preview with `mkdocs serve` or render static files with `mkdocs build` (output goes to `site/`).

MkDocs reads from the generated `mkdocs_docs/` tree, so updating any section and re-running the helper script keeps the browsing experience current.

### Automatic publishing

Changes pushed to `main` automatically rebuild and publish the MkDocs site via `.github/workflows/docs.yml`. After the initial deploy, configure GitHub Pages to serve from the `gh-pages` branch to make updates live.

## Contributing

Issues and pull requests are welcome. Please open an issue to discuss large changes or questions about the specification. See the [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) file for more details.
