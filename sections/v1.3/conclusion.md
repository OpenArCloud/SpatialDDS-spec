## **5. Conclusion**

SpatialDDS provides a lightweight, standards-based framework for exchanging real-world spatial data over DDS. By organizing schemas into modular profiles — with Core, Discovery, and Anchors as the foundation and Extensions adding domain-specific capabilities — it supports everything from SLAM pipelines and AR clients to digital twins, smart city infrastructure, and AI-driven world models. Core elements such as pose graphs, geometry tiles, anchors, and discovery give devices and services a shared language for building and aligning live models of the world, while provisional extensions like Neural and Agent point toward richer semantics and autonomous agents. Taken together, SpatialDDS positions itself as a practical foundation for real-time spatial computing—interoperable, codec-agnostic, and ready to serve as the data bus for AI and human experiences grounded in the physical world.
