## **7. Future Directions**

While SpatialDDS establishes a practical baseline for real-time spatial computing, several areas invite further exploration:

* **Reference Implementations**  
  Open-source libraries and bridges to existing ecosystems (e.g., ROS 2, OpenXR, OGC APIs) would make it easier for developers to adopt SpatialDDS in robotics, AR, and twin platforms.  
* **Semantic Enrichment**  
  Extending beyond 2D/3D detections, future work could align with ontologies and scene graphs to enable richer machine-readable semantics for AI world models and analytics.  
* **Neural Integration**  
  Provisional support for neural fields (NeRFs, Gaussian splats) could mature into a stable profile, ensuring consistent ways to stream and query neural representations across devices and services.  
* **Agent Interoperability**  
  Lightweight tasking and coordination schemas could evolve into a standard Agent profile, supporting multi-agent planning and human-AI collaboration at scale.  
* **Standards Alignment**  
  Ongoing coordination with OGC, Khronos, W3C, and GSMA initiatives will help ensure SpatialDDS complements existing geospatial, XR, and telecom standards rather than duplicating them.

Together, these directions point toward a future where SpatialDDS is not just a protocol but a foundation for an open, interoperable ecosystem of real-time world models.

We invite implementers, researchers, and standards bodies to explore SpatialDDS, contribute extensions, and help shape it into a shared backbone for real-time spatial computing and AI world models.
