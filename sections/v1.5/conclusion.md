## **5. Conclusion**

SpatialDDS provides a lightweight, standards-based framework for exchanging real-world spatial data over DDS. By organizing schemas into modular profiles — with Core, Discovery, and Anchors as the foundation and Extensions adding domain-specific capabilities — it supports everything from SLAM pipelines and AR clients to digital twins, smart city infrastructure, and AI-driven world models. Core elements such as pose graphs, geometry tiles, anchors, and discovery give devices and services a shared language for building and aligning live models of the world. The Mapping and Spatial Events extensions add multi-agent map exchange and zone-based alerting for fleet robotics and smart infrastructure, while provisional extensions like Neural and Agent point toward richer semantics and autonomous agents. Taken together, SpatialDDS positions itself as a practical foundation for real-time spatial computing—interoperable, codec-agnostic, and ready to serve as the data bus for AI and human experiences grounded in the physical world.
