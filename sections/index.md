# SpatialDDS Specification

Welcome to the SpatialDDS spec browser. Use the navigation to jump between the 1.4 draft, 1.3 release, and 1.2 release, or jump straight into the aggregated single-page versions linked below.

The Markdown sources in this repository remain the canonical reference for each release. MkDocs simply renders them with friendly navigation, search, and a responsive layout so you can skim or deep-dive from a browser without extra tooling.
